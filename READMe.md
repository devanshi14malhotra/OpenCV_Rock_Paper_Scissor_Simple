# Rock Paper Scissors - Hand Gesture Recognition

A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built in Jupyter Notebook using real-time hand gesture detection with OpenCV and MediaPipe.

## How It Works

- Rock → 0 fingers  
- Scissors → 2 fingers  
- Paper → 5 fingers  
- Press `s` to start a round  
- Press `q` to quit

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- MediaPipe  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Install

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe notebook
```

## Run

```bash
jupyter notebook rps.ipynb
```

Make sure your webcam is connected and your hand is visible during the game.
